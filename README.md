## Compiler Front-End ##
This project implements the front end of a compiler, featuring lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis. The goal is to process source code, identify errors, and prepare it for the back-end stages of compilation.

# Features
- Lexical Analysis: Converts input source code into tokens (keywords, identifiers, 
  literals, and symbols).
- Syntactic Analysis: Validates token sequences against the grammar to construct a syntax 
  tree.
- Semantic Analysis: Ensures logical correctness by verifying data types, variable
  declarations, and scope rules.
- Error Handling: Identifies and reports lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors with 
  meaningful messages.
